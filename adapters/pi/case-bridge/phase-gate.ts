/**
 * "Plan first" enforced where it can be enforced: at `tool_call`.
 *
 * The owner's complaint was that Pi starts searching immediately and produces a
 * conclusion, with Superpowers, C.A.S.E. and planning-with-files installed and
 * unused. The correction that shapes this file: "他多搜幾次是好的阿?越多越好不是?
 * 我抱怨的是他沒有先規劃就開始." So searching is not the target. Starting without
 * claiming and planning is.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-06 in the research-shaped run: the first eleven actions were
 * six searches and three page opens; the first advancer injection arrived after
 * them; the task's status never left PENDING. That measurement's own verdict
 * says a mechanism speaking at `turn_end` cannot catch a turn that already
 * searched — only `tool_call` can.
 *
 * `research/auto-pi` has this implemented (`extensions/loop.ts:1020`): a phase
 * tool allowlist refused at `tool_call`, PLAN read-only. Adopted. Its phase
 * model is not: ours comes from C.A.S.E. protocol state, because a second state
 * machine beside the protocol would fight it.
 *
 *     PENDING, unclaimed        CLAIM  research refused; reads and status.txt fine
 *     IN_PROGRESS, no plan      PLAN   deliverables refused; research WIDE OPEN
 *     otherwise                 open   nothing refused
 *
 * Fails open on anything it does not recognise. A gate that misfires in an
 * unfamiliar project is switched off within a day, and then it guards nothing.
