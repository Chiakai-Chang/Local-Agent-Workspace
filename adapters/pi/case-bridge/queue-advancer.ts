/**
 * The harness works out the next step, instead of hoping the model proposes one.
 *
 * Ten rounds of discussion converged on one sentence: code can decide *how* a
 * task is worked and cannot decide *whether* to start. Promoting
 * `case-framework` into the tier that carries descriptions was the last attempt
 * at the second half, and it was measured at 0/3 loads on a three-deliverable
 * brief.
 *
 * The 2026 literature names the two modes. Agent-proposed activation puts a
 * skill in front of the model and waits. Policy-mediated activation has the
 * system decide from configuration and triggers. Anthropic's guidance is
 * blunter: a deterministic backbone owns the flow, the model fills specific
 * steps.
 *
 * Pi has the backbone parts, and this repo already uses them — `sendMessage`
 * with `followUp` and `triggerTurn` is how async-exec wakes the agent. Verified
 * in a real session (019fcf32) before any of this was written:
 *
 *      8  ASSISTANT  text                       turn ended
 *      9  CUSTOM     universal-tag-transformer  injected
 *     10  ASSISTANT  bash                       a new turn, with a real call
 *
 * No user message between 8 and 10. The mechanism advances a turn; it had only
 * ever been used to correct one.
 *
 * The next step is looked up, never invented. Every row points at a clause of
 * `external/Local-Agent-Workspace/references/for_agents.md`, and every
 * condition is file existence. Nothing here judges content — this repo has
 * learned twice that demanding quality produces fabrication.
 *
 * What this does not fix, stated plainly: the instruction is still text, and
 * the model can still ignore it. What changes is the shape of the failure. A
 * model that quietly never starts is invisible; a model that ignores an
 * injected step leaves the queue in the same state, so the same step arrives
 * again — and a failure that repeats is a failure that can be counted.
