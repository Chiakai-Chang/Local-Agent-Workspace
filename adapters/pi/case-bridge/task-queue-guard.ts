/**
 * C.A.S.E. state transitions are tool calls, so they can be refused.
 *
 * Every transition in the protocol is one write to `status.txt`, and a write is
 * a `tool_call` — which fires *before* the tool runs, so the old value is still
 * on disk to compare against. That makes the state machine enforceable rather
 * than merely documented.
 *
 * It is worth saying why enforcement and not another reminder. Measured on this
 * harness in one day:
 *
 *   skill text ("cite each finding")        skipped 3/3
 *   systemPrompt note (task-shape routine)  delivered, 37 searches followed it
 *   core tier + full description            case-framework loaded 0/3
 *   tool_call {block, reason}               fired 3/3, URLs in files 0 -> 10/15
 *
 * The owner asked whether code could drive the framework's steps. It can, for
 * the half that is a transition. It cannot for the half that is a decision:
 * beginning to use C.A.S.E. has no before-state to compare with, which is
 * exactly why promoting the skill into the core tier changed nothing. These
 * guards say how the queue is worked; they say nothing about starting one.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow — writes landing inside
 * `02_Task_Queue/Task_<NNN>_<slug>/`. A project that does not use C.A.S.E.
 * never meets any of this.
 *
 * The rules encoded here are the protocol's *invariants*, not its transition
 * table. Copying the table would fork it, and this repo already carries a scar
 * from a frozen fork. The authority remains
 * `external/Local-Agent-Workspace/references/for_agents.md`.
