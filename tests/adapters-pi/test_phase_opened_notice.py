"""The gate closed a door and nobody said when it opened again.

Measured 2026-08-08, the 4b research run. The turn-based exit ramp worked
exactly as designed — twenty refusals across four turns, one voice per turn,
and not one successful search before the task was claimed, down from fifteen.

Then the model claimed the task and never searched again. Twelve turns of
bash, read and write, zero `web_search`, although research is WIDE OPEN in the
PLAN phase. It wrote the reason into its own deliverable:

    ⚠️ 未經驗證: `web_search` 工具被 C.A.S.E. 框架攔截,以下版本號來自知識庫,
    可能已過時。

Its generalisation was rational. It had seen twenty refusals and zero "you can
now". The owner had been explicit that searching more is good and only the
ordering was wrong, so premature searches 15 -> 0 is the win and real research
15 -> 0 is the bill.

Third time for this shape: the citation gate took URLs in files from 0 to 10
and fabricated ones from 0 to 4; the first phase gate refused and the status
never left PENDING. The sharper statement is not "a threshold defines the shape
of the evasion" — there was no evasion here, the model dropped the capability.
It is: **a guard that removes an option must be paired with something that
speaks when the option comes back.**

The carrier cannot be the advancer. It speaks only on a turn that produced text
and called no tools, and turns 6 to 15 all called tools, so the notice would
have arrived at turn 16. It has to ride the tool result of the claim itself —
one of the two channels measured to reach the model in this project.
