"""Plan first, enforced where it can actually be enforced.

The owner's complaint, twice, verbatim: Pi "還是會直接開始搜尋網頁,然後煞有其事的
搜尋可能十幾次,然後給我一個結論" — and then the correction that matters:
"他多搜幾次是好的阿?越多越好不是? 我抱怨的是他沒有先規劃就開始."

So this gate does not restrain searching. It restrains *starting without
claiming and planning*. Measured 2026-08-06 in the research-shaped run: the
first eleven actions were six searches and three page opens, the first advancer
injection landed after them, and the task's status never left PENDING. Our own
verdict from that measurement says the advancer speaks at `turn_end` and cannot
catch a turn that already searched — only `tool_call` can.

`research/auto-pi` implements exactly that (`extensions/loop.ts:1020`): a phase
tool allowlist enforced at `tool_call`, where PLAN is read-only. What is NOT
copied is its phase model — ours is derived from C.A.S.E. protocol state, because
a second state machine running beside the protocol would fight it.

  PENDING, nothing claimed   -> CLAIM phase: research tools refused, reads fine,
                                writing status.txt fine. Claiming costs one write.
  IN_PROGRESS, no plan yet   -> PLAN phase: deliverables refused, research tools
                                WIDE OPEN — planning is exactly when you look
                                things up.
  plan present               -> nothing refused.

And a layer taken from OmniHeal's 3-Strike: the second refusal must say something
different from the first — offer another way — before the third stands aside. A
guard that repeats itself verbatim and then gives up has taught nothing.
